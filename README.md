# LittleProgrammingProjects
Personal Programming Projects, too small for their own repository

Contents:
1. Anygma [Py] - Encoding text messages into PNG images and decoding them back. Currently being redone with better quality, functionality and UI on Java
2. Cellular Wallpapers [Py] - Generation of images of mandelbrot set, langton's ant and other mathematical patterns
3. Code Breaker [Py] - Originally university project, a wordle-like game with word guessing and program feedback on correct guesses
4. Coin Flipper [Py] - A simulation of Saint Petersburg paradox, relating to a game, where winnings double with each consecutive lucky coin flip
5. Deutsch Machine [Py] - A very simple program which shows you a word in eng/deu and then in the opposite language. Requires the user to think of a translation and then check themselves
6. Image to ASCII [Py] - A tool to convert PNG images into ASCII art
7. Imba Downloader [Py] - YouTube video downloader. Can download in low and high quality, as well as mp3. Has unfinished progress bar and can't download age restricted vids
8. Legendary Roller [Py] - A bot for Balatro game, which restarts the 1st ante until it finds a charm tag containing the soul (legendary joker)
9. Markovka [Py] - Implementation of Markov Chains text generation
10. Mosh [Py] - A tool for data moshing. Supports only random moshing, but code can be modified for more precise byte editing. Currently being redone with better quality, functionality and UI on Java
11. N Queens Problem [Py] - A simulation of the n queens problem and search for its solution using various pathfinding algorithms
12. RSA Encryption Simluation [Py] - A simulation of the RSA encryption algorithm for its better understanding
13. Rubik's Cube Solving [Py] - A simulation of Rubik's Cube with its randomization and pathfinding algorithms for solution searching
14. Wolfram [Py] - Implementation of Wolfram Cellular Automata using PyGame
